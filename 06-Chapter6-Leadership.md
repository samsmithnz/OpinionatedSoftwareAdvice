# Leadership and managing teams

## Leading, not managing

A leader should not be there to micro-manage- unless you need to be micro-managed. (see [situational leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory))
Leaders are there
- To ensure that you can be the best you can. This could involve unblocking, protecting, and investing in you to free you up to do your best work. 
- A leader is there to motivate and inspire you
- A leader needs to provide the right incentives to motivate you to work
- A leader needs to recognize, acknowledge, and resolve dysfunction in the team, project, and/or organization. 
- A leader needs to lead by example. If a leader is terrorizing and bullying a vendor, the leader is teaching his employees to follow the same behaviors

Incentives on a team are everything. Money is important, but not everything. With a good manager and team, employees will stay longer and be more engaged. 
- One factor here is managing 'clever' developers. We want smart people on our team, but are they doing things that no-one else understands? Are they creating overly complex code just to feel clever? Or are they creating simple, well documented code that anyone can understand.
- Retention and attrition is a trailing indicator - by the time you look at these metrics, it's already too late.

Invest in yourself. Sleep and vacation is important to recharge and repair. 

Make it clear that your team mental health is just as important as their physical health. It's just as ok to have a sick day, as it is to have a 'sad' day. 

## Joining a new team

You've joined a new team, you can see there is a lot of potential to improve process by making changes. But first, spend some time observing and understanding why things are the way they are. Is it political? History? Lack of knowledge of a better way? There may be good reasons that things are inefficent, and if you rush to change these before fully understanding, you will upset a large proportion of the team. Instead of you observe, ask questions, you will create a full picture and plan to transform the team to a better state

## Interviews

The whole idea of an interview is to work out if you can work with this person- for potentially years, and that they will add value to your organization. When you are hiring, try to have an idea of what your dream team looks like, and what you need to make your team better.

**What to ask:**
- Test their knowledge of what they say they know- not what you know. 
- Verify that you could work with this person for multiple years. Do they fit into the culture? 
- Confirm that if this person doesnâ€™t know something, they are motivated to learn, **and will** learn it.

**What NOT to ask:**
- Asking them to draw the code for a recursive fibonacci sequence on a whiteboard does not advance any of these goals
- Random software trivia doesn't prove their knowledge - that is what Google is for. All you are doing is confirming that the employee knows random software trivia
- Proving you understand a quicksort algorithm doesn't prove anything, when in 2021, you can call Array.Sort() or ORDER BY, which works for 99.9% of situations
