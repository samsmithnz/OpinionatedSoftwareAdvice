# Leadership and managing teams

## Leading, not managing

A leader should not be there to micro-manage- unless you need to be micro-managed. (see [situational leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory))
Leaders are there
- To ensure that you can be the best you can. This could involve unblocking, protecting, and investing in you to free you up to do your best work. 
- A leader is there to motivate and inspire you
- A leader needs to provide the right incentives to motivate you to work
- A leader needs to recognize, acknowledge, and resolve dysfunction in the team, project, and/or organization. 
- A leader needs to lead by example. If a leader is terrorizing and bullying a vendor, the leader is teaching his employees to follow the same behaviors

## Interviews

The whole idea of an interview is to work out if you can work with this person for potentially years, and that they will add value to your organization. 

**What to ask:**
- Test their knowledge of what they say they know- not what you know. 
- Verify that you could work with this person for multiple years. Do they fit into the culture? 
- Confirm that if this person doesnâ€™t know something they are motivated to learn and will learn it.

**What NOT to ask:**
- Asking them to draw the code for a recursive fibonacci sequence on a whiteboard does not advance any of these goals
- Random software trivia doesn't prove their knowledge - that is what Google is for. All you are doing is confirming that the employee knows random software trivia
- Proving you understand a quicksort algorithm doesn't prove anything, when in 2021, you can call Array.Sort() or ORDER BY, which works for 99.9% of situations
