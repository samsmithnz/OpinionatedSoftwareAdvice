## Interviews

The whole idea of an interview is to work out if you can work with this person for potentially years, and that they will add value to your organization. 

**What to ask:**
- Test their knowledge of what they say they know- not what you know. 
- Verify that you could work with this person for multiple years. Do they fit into the culture? 
- Confirm that if this person doesnâ€™t know something they are motivated to learn and will learn it.

**What NOT to ask:**
- Asking them to draw the code for a recursive fibonacci sequence on a whiteboard does not advance any of these goals
- Random software trivia doesn't prove their knowledge - that is what Google is for. All you are doing is confirming that the employee knows random software trivia
- Proving you understand a quicksort algorithm doesn't prove anything, when in 2021, you can call Array.Sort() or ORDER BY, which works for 99.9% of situations
