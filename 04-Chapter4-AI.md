# AI

AI, or artifical intellience, is one of the most mis-used terms in technology today. Let's break it down

- AI: a computer that can learn. There are no computers that can do this independently today.  
- Machine learning: a cognitive service very focused on a skill (vision, speech, language, search, etc). These are very good at doing one thing - extracting text from an image, converting text to speech, or understanding the intent of a sentence. These are the building blocks of AI, and tyed together are very powerful - for example searching images and then using image recognition to verify the images are what we expect.  
- Deep learning: can learn a very focused skill. For example, picking out text from an image    
  
What is the state of AI today? There is no artifical intelligence. Most AI is really just machine learning and statistics. You take a picture and machine learning uses statistics to tell you what is in it, what the text reads, and facial expressions. 

## AI Accuracy

Note that AI is only is good as the data passed into it to learn. The data needs to be carefully filtered and organized. Garbage in == Garbage out. Where AI really excels today is with cognitive services. Image recognition, text<->speech, image->text, etc. These are very focused, well honed algorithms that work well.

## Generative AI

Generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor are similar to asking a peer to write a function for you, but faster. You still need to review the answer, write tests to validate it's correct, and keep your brain in the code. Vibe Coding, I believe, is the same as merging PR's from peers without checking their work. There are elements of Generative AI that are really good - rewriting emails or text - especially with some direction (e.g. rewrite this paragraph to be more impactful, or more persuasive). I estimate tools like Copilot make me between 20-30% more productive - definitely not nothing. It's a useful tool. It does highlight how terrible as humans we are at writing requirements - and when we ask for too much, we get a poor answer. 

Note: None of this article was written or rewritten with AI... yet.
