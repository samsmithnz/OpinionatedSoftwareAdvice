# SoftwareAdvice Outline

## Purpose: share best practices and focus teams on how to be really successful with software development
These are my personal views and do not reflect my employer

## Main points:
- Keep it simple stupid: complexity will come - don't intentionally add complexity.
- Everytime a developer is clever, an atrocity is committed: Keep it simple. Minimize RegEx, XSLT, or Linq, as it's very difficult to maintain/understand later. 
- Software is too complicated (don't add middleware you *might* need)
- Unit testing is important, but most misunderstand it. 
- DevOps/Agile is mostly about culture and behavior change, not tools - but most organizations butcher it to match 'their' process, instead of adapting to DevOps best practices

## Where code falls apart (Agile/DevOps/etc). 

  1. Creating the product
    1. DevOps & Agile
      1. Creating time on Backlog for technical debt and continuous improvement
    1. Code analysis
    2. Code Reviews
    3. Agreeing on formatting - using tools (EditorConfig) to take the opinion out of development
    1. Tools and technologies
    1. Monitoring for feedback
    1. Technology. When to use microservices. When not to. When to use containers. What language to use.
    2. Middleware. Frameworks. Packages. DI. Entity framework


## Managing technical debt

we need to understand what we have. What projects are older, what projects have risky/old technology. We need to catalog all applications



## Cloud Native
- VM's are not cloud native. If you are deploying VM's in 2021 for a new application, you are failing the cloud
- Multiple clouds have resilency, but also double the cost, financially, training, time, and complexity. Don't underestimate this. Don't think that Terraform makes you instantly multicloud. 

## Personal development/ Career planning

1. What do you like doing? What do you not like doing?
2. Where is your dream employer? What is your dream project?
